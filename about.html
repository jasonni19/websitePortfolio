<h1 class = header> About Me </h1>

<p class = bio> I am currently a second-year student at UCLA studying Mathematics of Computation. <br> I have a strong interest in back-end, front-end development, and Natural Language Processing. <br> <br> I was born and 
raised in the Sacramento area. <br> When I'm not working, I enjoy going to the gym, listening to music, basketball, photography, and annoying my cats. </p>
